## [Forecasting with generated time series](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Time-Series-and-Prediction/blob/4446dbae38c5dd9ba33aca71860aeec16377d4b8/Forecasting%20with%20generated%20time%20series/Forecasting%20with%20generated%20time%20series.ipynb)

In this Notebook we will be working with time series data. All of the data is going to be generated and we will implement several functions to split the data, create forecasts and evaluate the quality of those forecasts.


## [Predicting time series with Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Time-Series-and-Prediction/blob/4446dbae38c5dd9ba33aca71860aeec16377d4b8/Predicting%20time%20series%20with%20Deep%20Neural%20Network/Predicting%20time%20series%20with%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)

In the previous Notebook we didn't use machine learning techniques for our forecasts. Here we will be using a Deep Neural Network to create forecasts to see how this technique compares with the ones we already tried out. Once again all of the data is going to be generated.


## [Forecasting Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne dataset](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Time-Series-and-Prediction/blob/4446dbae38c5dd9ba33aca71860aeec16377d4b8/Forecasting%20Daily%20Minimum%20Temperatures%20in%20Melbourne%20with%20CNNs/Forecasting%20Daily%20Minimum%20Temperatures%20in%20Melbourne%20with%20CNNs.ipynb)

Here we will be using the Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne dataset which contains data of the daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990. In addition to be using Tensorflow's layers for processing sequence data such as Recurrent layers or LSTMs we will also use Convolutional layers to improve the model's performance.


## [Using RNNs to predict time series](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Time-Series-and-Prediction/blob/b0ba369f615d0b005a4017f40112946ececa7e55/Using%20RNNs%20to%20predict%20time%20series/Using%20RNNs%20to%20predict%20time%20series.ipynb)

In the previous Notebook we used a vanilla deep neural network to create forecasts for generated time series. This time we will be using Tensorflow's layers for processing sequence data such as Recurrent layers or LSTMs to see how these two approaches compare.


## [Monte Carlo Simulation with Stock price](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Time-Series-and-Prediction/blob/b0ba369f615d0b005a4017f40112946ececa7e55/Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation%20with%20Stock/monte-carlo-simulation-with-stock.ipynb)

Here we are doing a Monte Carlo Simulation with stock prices time series, downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
